# 🚀✨ Image Steganography: Secure Text Encryption in Images Using Python ✨🚀  

## 📚 Overview  

This project demonstrates **Image Steganography using Python**, focusing on **text encryption within images**. The encryption code hides messages by modifying the pixel values of an image, ensuring that the image remains visually unchanged. A password protection feature secures the encryption process, making it a reliable method for transmitting secret messages.

## 🚀 Steps to Run the Encryption Code  

### 1️⃣ **Prerequisites**  
- Install **Python 3** on your system.  
- Install required libraries using:  
  ```sh
  pip install opencv-python numpy
  ```
- A suitable IDE (e.g., **VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook**).  

---

### 2️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  

Clone the repository using the following command:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Chaitalipatil1403/SteganographyProject.git
cd SteganographyProject
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Add Required Image**  
Place your image file (e.g., `mypic.jpg`) inside the project directory.  

---

### 4️⃣ **Run the Encryption Code**  
Execute the encryption script:  
```sh
python ImageSteganography.py
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Enter Details When Prompted**  
- Enter your **secret message** and **password** when asked.  
- The program will generate an encrypted image (`Encryptedmsg.png`) in the project directory, containing the hidden message.  

🎯 **Encryption complete! Your message is now securely hidden within the image.**
